# Access Roles

every user that call one of endpoint api, must be authorized. and every user can have some roles. (just a label)

for example, a user can be `manager` and `normal_user` and `supporter` and these are just labels that save for every user.

but if you want all users access to read a process or execute an action, how?
we have a reserved access role for this. this is `_all_`. in default of all access roles on every where is `_all_`.
